# PAQ-and-LBSMM
This repository open-sources the PAQ algorithm and LBSMM multiplier for efficient CNN acceleration with 4-bit quantization and N:M structured sparsity. It enables high compression and FPGA-friendly deployment by combining pruning-after-quantization with a lightweight LUT-based multiplier for compact, high-throughput accelerators.
